    This calculates age graded performance, finish times, and paces.

    Usage:

    age_grader = AgeGrader()

    age_grader.age_graded_performance_factor(age, gender, distance, seconds)
    - the age graded performance factor as a decimal (.83 = 83%)

    age_grader.age_graded_finish_time(age, gender, distance, seconds)
    - the age graded finish time in seconds

    age_grader.age_graded_seconds_per_mile(age, gender, distance, seconds)
    - the age graded pace in seconds per mile

    age_grader.age_gender_distance_record(age, gender, distance)
    - returns the adjusted record for the given age, gender, and distance

    age_grader.gender_distance_record(gender, distance)
    - this is the "world record" for the distance
